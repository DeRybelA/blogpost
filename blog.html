			<h5> 10 facts about Tomorrowland (English version)</h5>
			<h6> Fact 1. The laser show can be too overwhelming for some people. </h6>
			<p> In 2009 two visitors of Tomorrowland reported a complaint about the lazer show.
				They claimed that the lazers had shined in there eyes and therefore caused a bleeding. </p>

			<h6> Fact 2: Tomorrowland makes servers explode. </h6>
			<p> This year there were too many people trying to buy a ticket at the same time.
				The ticketing company Timoco that was in charge of the online distribution for the ticketing couldn’t handle the pressure, so the organisation switched to paylogic after the first sales made the servers of timoco crash. </p>

			<h6> Fact 3. At Tomorrowland there are bigger houses then the one I live in.  </h6>
			<p> If you really have enough money then the Tomorrowland Mansion is the ultimate experience in luxury for you. On arrival to your mansion you will be greeted with a glass of bubbly.
				One Mansion 5 Day Pass is valid for up to 12 people and comes with a comfortable living area with sofa and dining table, 12 comfortable beds, a Mini kitchen with fully stocked fridge and a Jacuzzi. </p>

			<h6> Fact 4: There is a drugs depo just outside tomorrowland. </h6>
			<p> It is forbidden to use drugs, to deal drugs and/ or to be in possession of drugs on the festival grounds and camping site.
				Before you enter the festival ground or camping site you have the possibility to dispose the drugs in special drugs boxes, this without any consequences. </p>

			<h6> Fact 5: Tomorrowland is going to reduce your printing cost. </h6>
			<p> There will be no tickets this year. Tomorrowland is going to send you your personal festival bracelet which gives you acces to the festival ground and the camping.
				This will reduce entrance queues and makes the entrance to Tomorrowland and Dreamville more convenient. </p>

			<h6> Fact 6. There was a time when you could go to tomorrowland for free.  </h6>
			<p> The first edition of tomorrowland was held in 2005. During the first edition of Tomorrowland the organisation gave away a lot of free tickets just to make the festival more crowded.
				Believe it or not, but some of the dj’s in the line-up where Armin van buuren, Ferry Corsten, and Chuckie. </p>

			<h6> Fact 7: Tomorrowland makes you feel fresh. </h6>
			<p> The toilets at Tomorrowland and DreamVille are free to use. The toilets will also be cleaned regularly.
				There are special FreshPoints at the festival site where you can freshen up yourself.
				There are even special guys who spray deodorant under you arm pits if you ask them. </p>

			<h6> Fact 8: When the music stops it doesn’t mean that the party is over. </h6>


			<h6> Fact 9: Tomorrowland is held in tree. </h6>
			<p> Tomorrowland takes place at recreation area, De Schorre, in Boom. The town of Boom is situated in Belgium, between Antwerp and Brussels.
				Boom means Tree in Dutch. That’s why they built a massive tree for the 7th edition of tomorrowland.</p>

			<h6> Fact 10. Before Rutgr, there was Kamiel the housephotographer of tomorrowland.  </h6>
			<p> The now 76 year old Kamiel de Clerck was present  for over 7 editions now. He really enjoys his job as the amature house photographer of tomorrowland.
				Manu Beers of the organisation is aslo really happy with Kamiel. “With out Kamiel there wouldn’t be a tomorrowland” </p>
